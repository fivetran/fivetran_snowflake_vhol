# Google Ads (Source)

This package models Google Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/google-ads).

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Google Ads transform package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads) and our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting).  The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
 * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
 * Timestamps are appended with `_timestamp`
 * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the campaign table's ID column is renamed `campaign_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/google_ads_source
    version: [">=0.7.0", "<0.8.0"]
```
## Configuration

This package allows users to leverage either the Adwords API or the Google Ads API. You will be able to determine which API your connector is using by navigating within your Fivetran UI to the `setup` tab -> `edit connection details` link -> and reference the `API configuration` used. You will want to refer to the respective configuration steps below based off the API used by your connector. 

> **Note**: As of April, 2022 all Fivetran Google Ads connectors leverage the Google Ads API rather than Adwords. Additionally, please be aware that the Adwords API version of the package will be sunset in August of 2022.
### Google Ads API Configuration
If your connector is setup using the Google Ads API then you will need to configure your `dbt_project.yml` with the below variable:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  api_source: google_ads  ## google_ads by default, but may be changed to 'adwords' if using a previous version of the connector.
```

### Adwords API Configuration
If your connector is setup using the Adwords API then you will need to pull the following custom reports through Fivetran:

* Destination Table Name: `final_url_performance`
* Report Type: `FINAL_URL_REPORT`
* Fields:
  * AccountDescriptiveName
  * AdGroupId
  * AdGroupName
  * AdGroupStatus
  * CampaignId
  * CampaignName
  * CampaignStatus
  * Clicks
  * Cost
  * Date
  * EffectiveFinalUrl
  * ExternalCustomerId
  * Impressions

* Destination Table Name: `criteria_performance`
* Report Type: `CRITERIA_PERFORMANCE_REPORT`
* Fields:
  * AccountDescriptiveName
  * AdGroupId
  * AdGroupName
  * AdGroupStatus
  * CampaignId
  * CampaignName
  * CampaignStatus
  * Clicks
  * Cost
  * Criteria
  * CriteriaDestinationUrl
  * CriteriaType
  * Date
  * ExternalCustomerId
  * Id
  * Impressions

* Destination Table Name: `click_performance`
* Report Type: `CLICK_PERFORMANCE_REPORT`
* Fields:
  * AccountDescriptiveName
  * AdGroupId
  * AdGroupName
  * AdGroupStatus
  * CampaignId
  * CampaignName
  * CampaignStatus
  * Clicks
  * CriteriaId
  * Date
  * ExternalCustomerId
  * GclId

The package assumes that the corresponding destination tables are named `final_url_performance`, `criteria_performance`, and `click_performance` respectively. If these tables have different names in your destination, enter the correct table names in the `google_ads__final_url_performance`, `google_ads__click_performance`, and `google_ads__criteria_performance` variables so that the package can find them:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    google_ads__final_url_performance: "{{ ref('a_model_you_wrote') }}"
    google_ads__click_performance: adwords.click_performance_report
```

### Source Schema is Named Differently

By default, this package will look for your Google Ads data in the `adwords` or `google_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile), depending on which API source you are using. If this is not where your Google Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    google_ads_schema: your_schema_name
    google_ads_database: your_database_name
```
## Optional Configurations
### Passing Through Additional Metrics
By default, this package will select `clicks`, `impressions`, and `cost` from the source reporting tables to store into the staging models. If you would like to pass through additional metrics to the staging models, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
    # If you're using the Adwords API source
    google_ads__url_passthrough_metrics: ['the', 'list', 'of', 'metric', 'columns', 'to', 'include'] # from adwords.final_url_performance
    google_ads__criteria_passthrough_metrics: ['the', 'list', 'of', 'metric', 'columns', 'to', 'include'] # from adwords.criteria_performance

    # If you're using the Google Ads API source
    google_ads__ad_stats_passthrough_metrics: ['the', 'list', 'of', 'metric', 'columns', 'to', 'include'] # from google_ads.ad_stats
```

### UTM Auto Tagging Feature
This package assumes you are manually adding UTM tags to the `EffectiveFinalUrl` field within the `FINAL_URL_REPORT` table. If you are leveraging the auto-tag feature within Google Ads then you will want to enable the `google_auto_tagging_enabled` variable to correctly populate the UTM fields within the `stg_google_ads__final_url_performance` model.
```yml
vars:
    google_ads_source:
      google_auto_tagging_enabled: true # False by default
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Google Ads staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_google_ads`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your Google Ads  staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    google_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

## Database Support

This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres, and Databricks.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
dbt `v0.20.0` introduced a new project-level dispatch configuration that enables an "override" setting for all dispatched macros. If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```
